\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{D}{igital} to Analogue Converter is an essential interface component heavily used in modern technology. It generates an analogue voltage signal based on its digital inputs. In this coursework \cite{cw}, a DAC with 8-bit precision and serial data input was designed using full custom CMOS process, so that it can potentially be used as a component in integrated circuits.
 
\hfill \today

\section{System Overview}

There are 3 possible topologies for this coursework \cite{cw}, R-2R Ladder based, capacitor array based or current steering based \cite{dac}.

It would be quit difficult to match resistors for R-2R Ladder topology. Moreover, parasitic resistances of MOSFETs may significantly affect the accuracy.

For capacitor array and current steering topology, the size of capacitors or the width of MOSFETs need to be doubled for each bit. For the specified 8-bit resolution, that would require about 512 times the layout area of a unit component. The current steering topology will also be affected by MOSFET parasitic resistances, whereas the capacitor array topology will only be affected by parasitic capacitances, which can be insignificant compare to the unit capacitor for an 8-bit DAC.

Further more, a split capacitor can be used in the capacitor array topology. By splitting the capacitors to 2 groups of 4 bits, only about 32 times the layout area of a unit capacitor would be needed. Common centroid and dummy devices layout techniques can also be used to improve component matching. By not having a continuous current flow comparing to the other 2 topologies, it would have a lower static power consumption. Therefore the capacitor array approach with a split capacitor was used in this coursework.

\fref{fig_system} shows the system block diagram of the proposed DAC design.

\end{figure}

Data clock is generated inside the DAC module by a 10MHz ring oscillator.

Serial data input and enable signal are captured by 2 D-type flip-flops (DFF) at raising edge of the clock. These DFFs are used to avoid metastability issues, when inputs are changing at the same time the clock signal is rising. They will also hold the input for the rest of the clock cycle.

The serial data input then enters an 8-bit shift register. It will register each bit and output as an 8-bit parallel interface for the capacitor array. The clock to shift register was gated by the enable signal, so it will hold the output when enable is not asserted.

The capacitor array consists of binary weighted capacitors. It works by charge redistribution that happens when different capacitors are hold at different voltage levels, with another terminal connected together. Therefore, it is essential to always release the existing charges on the capacitors before every conversion. Thus another input switch that connects the capacitor array inputs to ground during reset is needed.

According to specification, the output range should be from $0.4 V$ up to $1.4 V$. Therefore, voltage references are needed to biasing the capacitor array, so that it works at the specified voltage range. Overall gain and offset errors can also be compensated by adjusting the voltage references.

The output impedance of the capacitor array is very high, as there are only capacitors connected. Therefore, an output amplifier is required.

\section{Circuit Implementation}

\subsection{Clock generation}

The 10MHz digital clock is generated by using a ring oscillator. \fref{fig_ringosc} shows the schematic and layout design of the ring oscillator. Long channel MOSFETs are used to reduce oscillation frequency. 2 inverters are used to amplify and shape the output. Simulations are used to tune MOSFET parameters.

The spacing between N+ implant and the cell boundary is $0.2 \mu m$, half the design rule for N+ implant spacing ($0.4 \mu m$), same as others. It also has the same cell height of $8 \mu m$ as other digital blocks, so it can be placed tightly with other digital blocks.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Digital blocks}

\subsubsection{Shift register}

The shift register was realised by chaining 8 D-type flip-flops. Special D-type flip-flops that have inverted clock input and both inverting and non-inverting outputs was used, to remove the need of a few inverters.

\fref{fig_clock} shows the clock gating of the shift register. The clock input to the NAND is inverted, to prevent potential clock glitch that might happen when clock rises then buffered enable signal falls a bit later. Because of propagation delay, the clock signal to shift register will be delayed related to the clock generator. Therefore, it would be better to sample the buffered data input at falling edge, hence the inverted clock input.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{clock}
	\caption{Shift register clock gating}
	\label{fig_clock}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Input reset switches}

The input switches are simply 8 NANDs. The input of capacitor array drives MOSFETs arranged like an inverter, thus the output of this stage should be inverted. Inverted enable signal come from input buffer was used, so the output will be high when enable is asserted. Also using the inverted output from shift register, simple NANDs are sufficient.

\subsection{Capacitor array}

\fref{fig_cap_split} shows a 6-bit charge-scaling DAC realised using capacitor array with split capacitor.

%\begin{figure}[!t]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{cap_basic}
%	\caption{Charge-scaling DAC (adapted from \cite{cap_dac})}
%	\label{fig_cap_basic}
%\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{cap_split}
	\caption{A charge-scaling DAC using split array (adapted from \cite{cap_dac})}
	\label{fig_cap_split}
\end{figure}

After initial discharge, by having binary-weighted capacitors connected to either VREF or GND, the capacitors will be charged, with output node have a voltage proportional to charge distribution, hence the name "charge-scaling". There are no static current flow in the capacitor array, therefore very power efficient. It is very sensitive to parasitic capacitances, so the capacitors need to be big enough to overcome them.

However, if the capacitor array has not been reset for a long time, the output might drift because of leaking current changes charge distribution on output node. Having a larger unit capacitor might slower this process.

The unit capacitor was determined to be $12 \mu m \times 12 \mu m$, a sensible value for efficient layout area usage and sufficient enough to meet the specifications.

%\fref{fig_cap_sch} shows the actual schematic of capacitor array design, including dummy capacitors.

%\begin{figure}[!t]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{cap_sch}
%	\caption{Schematic design of capacitor array}
%	\label{fig_cap_sch}
%\end{figure}

\fref{fig_cap_lay} shows the actual layout design of the capacitor array. M and L capacitors corresponding to capacitors used in most significant bits and least significant bits respectively, while S capacitors form the split capacitor. Dummy capacitors (D) were also added for better matching around the edge.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{cap_lay_4x}
	\caption{Lay design of capacitor array}
	\label{fig_cap_lay}
\end{figure}

The capacitors are placed in a common centroid configuration, as indicated by the text on each unit capacitor. In this arrangement, component value variation caused by first order gradient on wafer will be cancelled out.

\subsection{Voltage references}

\fref{fig_ref_sch} shows the schematic of voltage references generation. Since the loads are only capacitors, a simple potential divider should be sufficient for $0.4 V$ output. The output will become stable at the desired voltage after capacitors are charged. The $1.4 V$ is achieved by using an amplifier, which is a 2-stage op amp design from previous laboratory sessions.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{ref_sch}
	\caption{Schematic design of voltage references}
	\label{fig_ref_sch}
\end{figure}

The outputs are tuned a bit higher than the voltage ranges specified, in order to compensate for gain and offset errors, according to simulation.

\subsection{Output amplifier}

A simple non-inverting amplifier was used as output amplifier. The same 2-stage op amp was used.

\subsection{Top-level overview}

\fref{fig_top_lay} shows the entire layout design of the DAC. The dimension of the layout is about $200 \mu m \times 132 \mu m$.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{top_lay}
	\caption{Layout design of the DAC}
	\label{fig_top_lay}
\end{figure}

P guarding rings was added around each analogue components to provide better substrate contact and isolation between components. Metal conductors for analogue signals and power tracks were also made thicker, to reduce parasitic resistances.

\section{Simulated Results}

The ring oscillator was simulated by applying a $1.8 V$ supply. It is simulated and tuned separately, because the simulation of the entire DAC module depends on an accurate clock. \fref{fig_sim_osc} shows the transient simulation waveform of the ring oscillator.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sim_osc}
	\caption{Transient simulation of ring oscillator. Red: Waveform on the ring; Blue: Buffered output}
	\label{fig_sim_osc}
\end{figure}

The frequency of the ring oscillator was calculated as shown in \eref{eq_freq}. It satisfied the specification of $10 \pm 0.1 MHz$.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq_freq}
	f = \frac{1}{T} \approx \frac{1}{100.2726 ns} \approx 9.973 MHz
\end{equation}

Simulation of the DAC module was done by using the provided test script. It will test every input codes, output the results as text. Therefore, the results can be easily processed in a spreadsheet application afterwards.

\fref{fig_output} shows the reference and simulation output voltages. There is always a small error exists between them.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{Output}
	\caption{Reference and simulation output of the DAC design}
	\label{fig_output}
\end{figure}

\fref{fig_error} shows the relative error between DAC output and reference. Relative error was calculated as shown by \eref{eqn_error}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn_error}
	ERR_{rel} = abs(Reference - VOUT) / Reference
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{Error}
	\caption{Relative error of the DAC design output}
	\label{fig_error}
\end{figure}

It can be seen from the chart that the overall error is not linear. This is affected by parasitic capacitances on MSB side. The parasitic capacitances on LSB side is reflected by small changes in error that repeats every 16 steps.

Voltage references were tuned to move the error curve centred around zero, gives the minimum absolute relative error.

The relative error can be further reduced by increasing the unit capacitance, so that the parasitic capacitances will become more insignificant. However, this will increase the layout area, and since the design already meet the specification of less than $1.5 \%$, the capacitors were not changed.

The test script also gives power consumption values. These can be calculated by measuring the current supplied by the $1.8 V$ power source. The static power consumption of this design is $5.2246 mW$, and the dynamic power consumption is $5.0504 mW$. It satisfied the specification of less than $20 mW$.

\fref{fig_sim_dac} shows a fraction of transient simulation for the DAC. It shows the time between the rising edge of enable signal and output stable is about $921 ns$, approximately $1.08 MHz$, meets the specification of at least $500 kHz$.
